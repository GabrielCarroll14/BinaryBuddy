BINARY BUDDY

ABOUT:
	BINARY BUDDY IS A TAMAGOTCHI STYLE PYTHON GAME I AM MAKING IN MY SPARE TIME. IT CONSISTS OF A TKINTER GUI SO ANYONE WANTING TO CONTRIBUTE TO IT WOULD HAVE TO BE 	FAMILIAR WITH THE BASICS OF TKINTER.

HOW TO PLAY:
	TO PLAY RUN THE APPLICATION THEN ENTER A NAME FOR YOUR PET AND A TYPE, THE TYPES CONSIST OF (CAT, DOG AND RABBIT). CLICK CONTINUE. THEN YOU WILL BE BROUGHT TO HOME 	SCREEN, THIS WILL GIVE YOU MULTIPLE OPTIONS (HAPPINESS, ENERGY, MOOD). EACH OF THESE HAS SUB MENUS WITH OPTION TO TRY AND IMPROVE YOUR ANIMALS WELLBEING, AFTER YOU HAVE 	SELECTED AN OPTION IT WILL TELL YOU IF WHAT YOU DID HELPED YOUR ANIMAL. AFTER THIS YOU WILL GET A NEW WINDOW DISPLAYING THE HEATH PERCENTAGES OF THE ANIMALS. 

COMING SOON:
	COMING SOON TO BINARYBUDDY IS A FEATURE TO RETURN TO PREVIOUS SAVES OF YOUR ANIMAL SUCH AS THERE NAME HEALTH AND TYPE. ALSO COMING IS A HIGH SCORES FEATURE WHICH ALLOWS 	USER TO SAVE DATA TO A PLAIN TEXT FILE.

CONTRIBUTING:
	AS THIS PROJECT IS NOT FULLY COMPLETE I WOULD LOVE FOR SOMEONE TO CONTRIBUTE, THIS WILL MAKE BUILDING IT A LOT EASIER. THE CONTRIBUTER WOULD NEED BEGINNER SKILLS OF PYTHON 	AND TKINTER.
